Unit IV serves as EMNAR‚Äôs dedicated packaging and warehousing hub, with significant capacity‚Äîhandling up to 500,000 fiber drums annually, available in various sizes to meet the diverse storage and transport needs of APIs and intermediates. Sustainability Page Sustainability at Emnar Pharma At Emnar Pharma, sustainability is embedded in everything we do‚Äîfrom research and development to manufacturing and delivery. As we continue to grow, we remain committed to minimizing our environmental footprint while upholding the highest standards of health, safety, and corporate responsibility. Responsible Growth with Environmental Care Over the past six years, Emnar‚Äôs sales have more than doubled. However, our emissions and use of natural resources have grown at a much slower pace. This reflects our firm commitment to resource efficiency and environmental responsibility. We strive to minimize the ecological impact of our operations and products throughout their entire life cycle. Environmental Certifications and Compliance Our dedication to sustainability is backed by recognized global standards. Emnar Pharma is certified with: ISO 14001:2015 ‚Äì Environmental Management Systems WHO-GMP ‚Äì Good Manufacturing Practice with environmental safeguards Compliance with international norms for monitoring volatile organic compounds (VOCs), greenhouse gas emissions, and effluent discharge These certifications ensure we continuously monitor, control, and reduce our environmental impact in line with global best practices. Air, Water, and Waste Management We actively work to limit emissions into the air and water by implementing real-time monitoring systems across our facilities. All environmental metrics‚Äîincluding VOCs, greenhouse gases, and wastewater‚Äîare tracked and managed in accordance with international standards. Emnar follows a structured waste management strategy that focuses on: Prevention of waste generation Reduction at the source Recycling and reuse wherever possible Our goal is to reduce landfill waste and promote circular practices throughout the value chain. Health, Safety, and Workplace Responsibility We believe that a safe workplace is the foundation of a sustainable organization. Emnar is committed to ensuring the health and safety of all employees across our units. Our safety programs emphasize: A strong safety culture Behavior-based safety training Ongoing risk assessments and process improvements These efforts have led to consistent improvements in occupational health and safety across all our manufacturing sites.
